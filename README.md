This is the basic SpringBoot example clearing the basic concepts of autowired, componentscan for packages etc.

@RestController  //makes the controller as restconroller to be accessible with url
@Autowired   //will make instance of class without new keyword
@Component   //will make the class as component so that it can be autowired
